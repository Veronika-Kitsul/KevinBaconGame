# Kevin Bacon Game

Hello and welcome to the Kevin Bacon Game! It contains a huge database of actors and movies, so you can play around with their connections. 
You have two text fields to enter two actors, and you can perform three operations on them. 
First,  you can find the shortest path from one actor to another through movies they stage in and common colleagues. 
For the second one, you only need one actor, and even if you input two, we will run the search for for the farthest actor in the map for just the first one. 
The third feature is to show three shortest paths how to get from the first actor to the second one. 
Names of actors have to be their real names inputted correctly. The program will ask you to try again if you input the name incorrectly.
The game is build based on the graph alogirthm Breadth First Search.
